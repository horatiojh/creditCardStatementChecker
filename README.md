# Credit Card Statement Checker
This was a script written to quickly count the total sum of my credit and debit transactions in my SC Spree Credit Card statement, so that I could check that the billed amount is accurate. It takes the downloadable CSV statement from the SC Banking website as an input, and returns a bunch of print statements which check that the value is correct. 

A possible extension of this project is to calculate the eligible cashback on my transactions to ensure that it corroborates with the actual cashback that I'm receiving from SC.
